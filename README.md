# GameTank Lua SDK

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/gtlua.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gtlua)

Make games for the [**GameTank**](https://gametank.zone/) - Clyde Shaffer's open
8-bit console (65C02 CPU, hardware blitter, a 128×128 screen) - by writing Lua
instead of 6502 assembly or C.

Write games in a **PICO-8-flavored Lua** dialect. The SDK **ahead-of-time
compiles** your Lua to C, builds it with cc65 against a bundled GameTank runtime,
and produces a `.gtr` cartridge (a flat 32 KB EEPROM, or a 2 MB FLASH2M banked
cart for bigger games - chosen automatically). No interpreter, no VM: your Lua
becomes native 65C02 machine code, so the cartridge runs at full speed in the
[emulator](https://github.com/clydeshaffer/GameTankEmulator), on
[gametank.zone](https://gametank.zone/), and on real hardware via
[GTFO](https://github.com/clydeshaffer/gtfo).

No interpreter, no VM: your Lua becomes native 65C02 machine code. The
screen is the same 128×128 as PICO-8's, and the API is PICO-8-shaped
(`spr`/`btn`/`_init`/`_update`/`_draw`, Lua syntax), so if you know PICO-8 you'll
feel at home - but gt-lua is its own thing targeting real GameTank hardware, not
a PICO-8 clone. If you don't know PICO-8, you don't need to.

## Your first game

This is a complete GameTank game. No assets, no boilerplate - one `main.lua`:

```lua
function _draw()
  cls(1)                          -- dark blue background

  print("hello gametank", 38, 14, 14)   -- title text, pink, near the top

  -- a smiley face, drawn entirely with shapes (no sprite sheet needed)
  circfill(64, 72, 26, 10)        -- head: a big yellow circle
  rectfill(53, 62, 58, 68, 0)     -- left eye: a black square
  rectfill(70, 62, 75, 68, 0)     -- right eye
  circfill(64, 82, 9, 0)          -- mouth: a black circle
end
```

Build it and play it in a window:

```sh
node bin/gtlua.js run examples/hello/main.lua
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monteslu/gametank_lua_sdk/main/docs/img/hello.png" width="384" alt="hello gametank: a yellow smiley face on a dark blue screen">
</p>

Or compile it to a `.gtr` cartridge (to run in an emulator or flash to hardware):

```sh
node bin/gtlua.js build examples/hello/main.lua -o hello.gtr
```

That's the whole loop: write `main.lua`, `run` it, ship the `.gtr`. Colors are
PICO-8-style indices `0-15` (`0` black, `1` dark-blue, `10` yellow, `14` pink);
`gt.rgb()` reaches the full 256-color GameTank palette when you want more.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) **24+** (the bundled cc65 + emulator WASM need
  it for WASM threading / SIMD)
- **nothing else** - the C toolchain (cc65) and the emulator both come bundled
  as WebAssembly via `npm install`. No native tools to build or install.

  (Optional: if you'd rather use a native cc65 - because you already have one, or
  want the source-clone path - the SDK uses it automatically when present. See
  "Build backends" below.)

`gtlua run` opens a window through
[`romdev-core-runner`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/romdev-core-runner) - the
one SDL host shared across the whole SDK family and the romdev playtest tool.
The window needs `@kmamal/sdl`, an *optional* dependency of the runner (pulled
by `npm install`, prebuilt for the common platforms). On a headless box or an
unsupported platform it falls back to an external GameTank emulator; `gtlua
build` never needs it.

## Quickstart (zero install)

Clone it, install once, and you can **build and run** GameTank games with no
native toolchain and no separate emulator:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/monteslu/gametank_lua_sdk && cd gametank_lua_sdk
npm install                              # pulls the bundled cc65 WASM + emulator

# build one of the examples to a .gtr cartridge:
node bin/gtlua.js build examples/orbit/main.lua
# -> examples/orbit/main.gtr, in ~2 s (first) / instant after

# ...or build AND play it in a window, no emulator install needed:
node bin/gtlua.js run examples/orbit/main.lua
```

`gtlua run` opens a window (arrows move, Z/X/C are the buttons, Enter is start).
The `.gtr` it builds also runs in the
[GameTankEmulator](https://github.com/clydeshaffer/GameTankEmulator), on
[gametank.zone](https://gametank.zone/), or flashed to a real cartridge via
[GTFO](https://github.com/clydeshaffer/gtfo).

### Build backends

By default the build uses **native cc65 if it's on your `PATH` or built into
`tools/` (via `scripts/install_tools.sh`), otherwise the bundled WASM cc65** from
`npm install`. Both produce byte-for-byte identical carts. Force one with
`GTLUA_TOOLCHAIN=wasm` or `GTLUA_TOOLCHAIN=native`. So this works as a pure
clone-and-build SDK (like the official GameTank C SDK) too - install a native
cc65 and skip `npm install` if you prefer.

### Start your own game

Copy an example as a starting point and build your `main.lua`:

```sh
cp -r examples/orbit mygame
node bin/gtlua.js build mygame/main.lua -o mygame/game.gtr
# --sheet mygame/gfx.gtg     add a sprite sheet (see docs/GRAPHICS.md)
# --frames mygame/gfx.gsi    add a frame table for sprf (docs/SPRITES.md)
# --num8                     8.8 number mode, faster math (docs/performance.md)
```

Test it as you go with `run` (it builds, then opens the game in a window so you
can play it immediately - the tight edit/build/play loop):

```sh
node bin/gtlua.js run mygame/main.lua           # same flags as build
```

`node bin/gtlua.js c <file.lua>` prints the generated C (for debugging).

### Visual Studio Code

The repo ships VS Code tasks for one-key build & run. Open the folder in VS
Code, open any `.lua`, and:

- **Ctrl+Shift+B** (Cmd+Shift+B on macOS) runs **gtlua: Build** on the open file,
  producing `<name>.gtr` next to it.
- **gtlua: Build & Run** (from *Terminal → Run Task…*) builds, then launches the
  ROM in a detected emulator.

The **Run** task finds an emulator the same way the `run_emulator` scripts do:
the `GAMETANK_EMULATOR` env var first, then `gte` or `GameTankEmulator` on your
`PATH`. Point `GAMETANK_EMULATOR` at your
[GameTankEmulator](https://github.com/clydeshaffer/GameTankEmulator) build if
it isn't on `PATH`.

## The PICO-8 contract

Define `_update60()` (60 fps) or `_update()` (30 fps), plus `_draw()`, and
optionally `_init()`. The runtime latches inputs before each update and ends
the frame after `_draw()` (blitter drain, vblank, page flip).

**Numbers are PICO-8 numbers**: 16.16 fixed point, −32768 to 32767.99998,
wrap on overflow, division by zero saturates. `sin`/`cos`/`atan2` use turns
(0..1) with PICO-8's screen-space-inverted sin. Under the hood the compiler
infers which values stay integral and keeps them in fast 16-bit ints - an
optimization, never a semantic change.

**The dialect** keeps PICO-8's syntax: `+=`-style compound assignment,
one-line `if (cond) stmt` / `while (cond) stmt`, `!=`, `\` floor division,
`//` comments, hex/binary literals with fractions (`0x11.4`, `0b101.1`),
button glyphs (`⬅️➡️⬆️⬇️🅾️❎`), and multiple assignment (`x, y = 64, 32`).

**Have a PICO-8 cart to bring over?** [docs/PORTING.md](docs/PORTING.md) is the
step-by-step walkthrough (import the art with `gtlua gfx import`, the sound with
`p8sfx`, and what changes because the GameTank is different hardware); the
per-function compatibility map is

## API

| | |
|---|---|
| lifecycle | `_init` `_update` `_update60` `_draw` |
| graphics | `cls` `camera` `color` `palt(0,[transparent])` `pset` `rect` `rectfill` `circ` `circfill` `line` `sset` `spr(n,x,y,[w,h],[flip_x,flip_y])` - flips are free (hardware blitter mirror) |
| sprites | 8×8-grid `spr(n)` off a `.gtg` sheet (`--sheet`, [docs/GRAPHICS.md](docs/GRAPHICS.md)); `sprf(frame,x,y,[fx],[fy])` for arbitrary-size / animated frames off a `.gsi` table ([docs/SPRITES.md](docs/SPRITES.md)) |
| input | `btn(i,[pl])` `btnp(i,[pl])` - indices 0-3 d-pad, 4=🅾️(GT A), 5=❎(GT B), **6=GT C**, 7=START; `btnp` has PICO-8 auto-repeat |
| math | `flr` `ceil` `abs` `sgn` `sqrt` `min` `max` `mid` `sin` `cos` `atan2` `rnd` `srand` `t`/`time` |
| data | `array(n,[v])` - 16-bit elements · `array8(n,[v])` - byte elements 0-255, half the RAM and ~2× faster in counting loops |
| sound | `sfx(n,[ch])` `music(n,[loop])` (built-in FM effects/tunes - see below); `song(data,[loop])` plays a native `.gtm2` FM song ([docs/MUSIC.md](docs/MUSIC.md)); low-level `gt.note`/`gt.noteoff` |
| gametank extras | `gt.rgb(b)` - raw palette byte (the GameTank has 256 colors), `gt.border(c)`, `gt.ticks()`, `gt.starfield_*`, `gt.bg_compose`/`gt.bg_draw` (see below) |

Colors are raw GameTank bytes `0`–`255`. For PICO-8 familiarity, a **static
0–15 color literal** in a draw call (`cls(1)`, `rectfill(...,8)`) is baked to its
GameTank byte at compile time (zero runtime cost). `gt.rgb()` reaches the full
256-color palette: `gt.rgb(255,128,0)` picks the nearest hardware color to that
RGB, or `gt.rgb(byte)` takes a raw byte. Use it anywhere a color is expected:
`rectfill(x,y,w,h, gt.rgb(255,128,0))`. A color **computed at runtime** is used
as a raw byte, not re-mapped from 0–15 (see [docs/PALETTE.md](docs/PALETTE.md));
there is no runtime `pal()`.

### Fast backgrounds: `gt.bg_compose` / `gt.bg_draw`

Drawing a tilemap with a per-tile `spr()` loop costs one blit per visible
tile, and on the GameTank a blit is ~1200 cycles of setup *regardless of
size* - a screenful of tiles blows the ~50-blit/frame budget for 30fps. The
GameTank has 512 KB of sprite RAM (32 pages of 128×128) and the SDK normally
uses only one (the sheet), so you can pre-render a static background into a
spare page **once** and blit the whole thing as a single cheap blit each frame:

```lua
local map = array(16*16)          -- your tile indices (0 = empty)
function _init()
  -- ... fill map from your level data ...
  gt.bg_compose(map, 16, 0, 0, 16, 16)  -- (map, cols, cx, cy, cw, ch) -> bg page
end
function _draw()
  gt.bg_draw()                    -- one big blit of the composed page
  -- then draw your moving sprites on top with spr()
end
```

`gt.bg_compose` reads tiles from the loaded `--sheet` (cell N is at sheet cell
`(N%16, N//16)`), clears the page to color 0, and paints the `cw×ch` window
starting at map cell `(cx,cy)`; tile 0 is left empty. It's a one-time cost of
up to a second or so of CPU time (the canvas clear alone is 64 KB of writes) -
call it at level load, not every frame, and expect the screen to sit black
until `_init` returns.

The bg page is a **256×256 canvas** (`cw`/`ch` up to 32 cells), so a level
bigger than one screen composes once and **scrolls for free**: `gt.bg_draw(sx,
sy)` blits a 128×128 window at source offset `(sx,sy)` (0–128 in each axis),
seamlessly across the internal page boundaries - pass your camera position to
scroll. Moving/animated tiles still want `spr()` on top.

### Sound: `sfx` / `music`

The GameTank has a second 65C02 audio coprocessor (a 4-channel, 4-operator FM
synth). PICO-8 style, you trigger sound by index - no tracker files to author:

```lua
function _init()
  music(0)              -- start built-in tune 0, looping
end
function _update60()
  if btnp(4) then sfx(0) end     -- 🅾️ -> jump sound
  if btnp(5) then sfx(3) end     -- ❎ -> explosion
end
```

Built-in **effects** (`sfx(n,[ch])`, n = 0–7): `0` jump · `1` pickup · `2`
shoot · `3` explode · `4` blip · `5` powerup · `6` hurt · `7` select. Omit
`ch` to auto-assign one of the 4 channels, or pass `0–3` to pin it. Built-in
**tunes** (`music(n,[loop])`, n = 0–1): loops by default; `music(-1)` stops,
`music(n,false)` plays once. A per-frame sequencer (ported from the upstream
GameTank tracker) advances envelopes + steps the song automatically - it costs
almost nothing when nothing is playing. For a single raw tone, the low-level
`gt.note(ch,note,vol)` / `gt.noteoff(ch)` primitives are still there.

Shipped since: native `.gtg` sprite sheets + `.gsi`/`sprf` frame tables, native
`.gtm2` FM songs, a `gtlua gfx` converter, and a PICO-8 art/sound importer.
The v0.4 compatibility layer includes `map`/`mget`/`mset`, sprite flags, and
`cartdata`/`dget`/`dset` saves. Save-using games automatically build as 2 MiB
FLASH2M+RAM cartridges; see [docs/PICO8.md](docs/PICO8.md) for the roadmap.

## Not-Lua walls (loud, never silent)

Conditions must be boolean (`if x ~= 0 then`, not `if x then` - Lua calls 0
truthy, C doesn't, gtlua refuses to guess). No `nil`, closures, metatables,
coroutines, or `goto`. Every unsupported feature is a compile-time error
that says what to write instead.

## Repo layout

(register protocols, fixed-point core, math tables, interrupt handlers,
cc65 startup/linker files) · `bin/gtlua.js` CLI · `tools/` cc65 (built by
`scripts/install_tools.sh`) · `examples/` · `test/` (`node --test`).

The `examples/` in this repo are small, self-contained gt-lua programs (orbit,
mathcheck, pad-square, audio) - the quickest way to see the API in use. Full
games built with gt-lua live in their own repos (each a derivative work under
its own license): Combo Pool, newleste, Cherry Bomb, and more.

## Making it fast

The GameTank is ~1000× slower than the machine PICO-8 runs on, so a naive port
can drop to single-digit fps. **[docs/performance.md](docs/performance.md)** is
the field guide: the two things that dominate a frame (blit count and
fixed-point math), the ~19,000-cycle fixed-point `%` / `/` footgun and how to
dodge it, per-primitive blit budgets, and how to profile a slow cart by
bisection. Read it before optimizing - measure, don't guess.
